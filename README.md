The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the cutting edge of the electronics industry, following the internet itself.I have devised an innovative, streamlined approach to authenticate, encrypt, and distribute keys for IoT devices. This method leverages end-to-end quantum key cryptosystems for enhanced security and efficiency.
